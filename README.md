First thx to Gulo whom made the zombie faces and their smiles 
also thx to corvobrok & Chuma from whom i did some rewrite on script/.pbo

1 simple add @zombi in the root of arma III  (server and client)
2 backup MPMissions unless u know what ur doing else ur pc will start shaking and blowup within 15 sec.
3 merge MPMissions into the root of arma III 

Add the 2 lines to init.sqf
[] execVM "zombie\conf.sqf";
[] execVM "Tzombie\Tconf.sqf";


Well what do u get ,2 different types of Zeds
1 the old arma2 walking/running , edit the /zombie/conf.sqf  for own likeing
2 the Tzombie they run as fast as u can but can be misstaken as realplayer (no zombie movement)
